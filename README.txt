This repository is for my bash modules, utilities and usage examples.

Bash modules: scripts without execute right.
Utilities: scripts wished to be used under any Linux platform.
Usage examples: experimental scripts under Test directory.

Practice guide lines:
    Name script with prefix "lz-" to avoid name conflictions with system tools.
    Name script with suffix ".sh" to avoid name conflictions with other langs.
